                  <p>Who said that efficient college management, online exam management, or attendance management has to be
                    synonymous with
                    mountains of paperwork?</p>
                  <p>Managing classes, assessments, and attendance can be a huge challenge, especially if your school or
                    university lacks the
                    infrastructure required to handle management tasks with ease.</p>
                  <p>Paperwork is costly, takes up too much space in your facility, and can be easily lost, misplaced or
                    destroyed.</p>
                  <p>Thousands of schools and universities have to deal with this problem every single year.</p>
                  <p>Doing everything by hand on paper is not only time-consuming and expensive, but also counter-productive,
                    since you could
                    spend that time focusing on more important aspects of your curriculum.</p>
                  <p>That’s exactly why we have designed this paper-free school management system that will allow you to
                    perform
                    every single
                    task with unmatched convenience and ease – minus the huge pile of paperwork.</p>
